# Public-Transport-System
Application with simple command line UI. UI is currently in serbian.

## What application does?
Initial point in the UI is entering names of txt files that contain information about bus names and all bus stops and their connections.
After that you can choose if you want to display information about specific bus or a bus stop or you want to find the path between two bus stops.
You can choose between three strategies for finding the path:
1. You want to find any path
2. You want to find the shortest path
3. You want to find the path that has fewest bus changes
